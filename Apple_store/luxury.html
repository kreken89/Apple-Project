      <span>Maldives _____</span>
      <h2>Magical Maldives</h2>
      <p>"There's no place quite like the Maldives," says John, Luxury Travels advisor. "It's so remote, yet it offers
        absolute luxury." Located in the Indian Ocean roughly 600 miles southwest of Sri Lanka, the string of nearly
        1,200 coral
        islands is a utopia for divers, who can explore untouched reefs, pinnacles, caves, and exciting channels while
        swimming
        next to giant rays, curious turtles, and more than 1,000 species of fish. The archipelago also draws surfers to
        consistent swells that create seemingly endless breaks. The shimmering topaz water is incredibly clear (up to
        130 feet
        visibility), and so warm “it feels like a bath,” says John.

      <span>Bora Bora _____</span>
      <h2>French polynesias diamond</h2>
      <p>Bora Bora is filled with beautiful honeymoon destinations and we have reviewed them below. The St. Regis Bora Bora
      stands out as one of the best honeymoon destinations not just in Bora Bora but the world. The St. Regis is home to the
      largest overwater bungalows in the South Pacific and is our top recommended resort for honeymooning in Bora Bora. Our
      second recommendation is Le Meridien, a gorgeous resort that provides an exotic and luxurious honeymoon experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Explore Bora Bora easily from the luxury resort. Sail around the island's azure waters, or dive under to meet black tip
        reef sharks and rays up close. After your island adventure, swim in the Lagoonarium, work out in the fitness center, or
        unwind with a spa treatment. Order a cocktail at the swim-up bar, or sample international and Polynesian-inspired
        cuisine at our four restaurants. With its beautiful surroundings and refined amenities, the resort is a serene
        destination for your honeymoon.
